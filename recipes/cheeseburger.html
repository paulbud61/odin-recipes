    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The patty, crafted from finely ground beef, is infused with a symphony of
      flavors achieved through meticulous seasoning with salt and pepper.
      Elevating this creation to a new level of indulgence is the rich, melted
      embrace of cheddar cheese. As you sink your teeth into this delectable
      combination, crisp lettuce, juicy tomato slices, and piquant onion rings
      dance on your taste buds. The ensemble is harmonized by a trio of
      condiments—ketchup, mustard, and velvety mayonnaise—culminating in a
      symphony of textures and tastes that defines the timeless allure of the
      cheeseburger.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 lime, juiced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>6 slices Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>6 hamburger buns, split and toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat. Make the guacamole: Mash avocado,
      tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, lime juice, garlic, and salt together in a
      medium bowl. Make the burgers: Mix ground beef, onion, cilantro, garlic,
      lime juice, and chili powder together in a large bowl. Form meat into 6
      patties. Cook burgers on the preheated grill to desired doneness. Add a
      slice of cheese to each burger during the last minute of cooking. Serve on
      toasted buns with a dollop of guacamole.
