    <h1>Shawarma</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Like gyros, shawarmas are typically served on pitas. Shawarma meat is
      exceptionally flavorful and juicy, as it is marinated at length in spices
      like turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and garlic.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup malt vinegar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon mixed spice</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground cardamom</li>
      <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
      In a glass baking dish, mix together the malt vinegar, 1/4 cup yogurt,
      vegetable oil, mixed spice, cardamom, salt and pepper. Place the chicken
      thighs into the mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the
      refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350
      degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the tahini, 1/4
      cup yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and parsley. Season with salt
      and pepper, taste, and adjust flavors if desired. Cover and refrigerate.
      Cover the chicken and bake in the marinade for 30 minutes, turning once.
      Uncover, and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is
      browned and cooked through. Remove from the dish, and cut into slices.
      Place sliced chicken, tomato, onion, and lettuce onto pita breads. Roll
      up, and top with the tahini sauce.
