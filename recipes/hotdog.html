    <p>
      The hotdog, crafted from a blend of high-quality meats, is a succulent
      delight that promises a satisfying snap with each bite. The experience is
      elevated by a choice of condimentsâ€”tangy mustard, zesty ketchup, and the
      optional crunch of pickles. This portable pleasure captures the essence of
      comfort food, providing a quick and savory respite for those on the go.
      The hotdog stands as a testament to the enduring charm of uncomplicated
      yet gratifying culinary delights.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (2 ounce) hot dogs</li>
      <li>4 slices cold center-cut, thinly sliced bacon</li>
      <li>2 large hot dog buns</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dill pickle relish, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons diced red onion, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons diced tomato, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Place 1 hot dog horizontally at the top edge of 1 bacon slice; roll once
      to secure. Place the second hot dog on the bacon, directly under the first
      hot dog, and wrap bacon twice at an angle. Tuck between the hot dogs. Tuck
      in second bacon slice where you left off and roll over remaining half of
      the hot dogs. Secure the end between the hot dogs. Repeat with remaining
      hot dogs and bacon slices. Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and add
      bacon-wrapped hot dogs. Cook, turning as needed, until browned on all
      sides, about 10 minutes. Spread 1 tablespoon mustard over each bun. Add
      hot dogs. Top with dill pickle relish, red onion, and tomato.
